//! Highly optimized (and perceptually accurate) conversions between color
//! formats used by terminals.
//!
//! The main use case for this crate is to convert from a 24-bit RGB "true
//! color" triple into the "closest" color available in the 256-color palette
//! accepted by many terminals.
//!
//!
//!
//! Similarly, for many terminals, even if they *do* support 24-bit ANSI
//! escapes, they may use a naÃ¯ve conversion -- often one which is neither sRGB
//! correct nor perceptually accurate. s a result your program may look very
//! different when this is unavailable. Even if it did get this right (and I'm
//! not aware of any that do -- although this may be more because most terminals
//! actually )
//!
